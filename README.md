# Pocket-Chef
Pocket-Chef was originally a school project built by Michelle Lim, Mengning Yang, Danica Navaretnam, Jennifer Huynh and William Hirsch with some basic functionalitiee like creating recipes, publish recipes, user registration, view other user's recipes, etc. and I'm planning on continue building it to have it support more advanced features.
