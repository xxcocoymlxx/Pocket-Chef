# Pocket-Chef
Pocket-Chef was originally a school project built by Michelle Lim, Mengning Yang, Danica Navaretnam, Jennifer Huynh and William Hirsch with some basic functionalitiee like creating recipes, publishing recipes, user registration, and viewing other user's recipes, etc. and I'm planning on continue building it to support more advanced features.
